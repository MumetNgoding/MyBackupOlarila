Please read &quot;COPYING&quot;       for more info.<br>					<p><b>      Instructions:<br>						</b>To run this application, copy it to any folder on your hard drive (Applications,       Utilities, Desktop, etc.). When you open the program, you have two tabs       to select from: &quot;Rember&quot; and &quot;Log&quot;. The Rember tab will       let you select the number of test loops to perform, and the amount of memory       to test *. The Log tab will display the output of the &quot;memtest&quot;       process at run time.<br>					</p>					<p><b>Features</b><br>					</p>					<p>As of version 0.2b, there are Preferences that allow the user to quit all running applications, and/or the Finder. This allows for more available testing memory. There are now &quot;Verbose&quot; options in Preferences, and the &quot;Log&quot; view. This will toggle an output filter, displaying more/less output from memtest.<br>					</p>					<p>Version 0.3b contains a 64-bit version of memtest, breaking memory testing       barriers that were present in past versions. It is also possible to stop       testing upon the detection of errors. Preferences are now saved in user       defaults.<br>					</p>					<p>Version 0.3.4 provides a memory information window, and a report window that provide more user-friendly feedback. When testing in Rember, the program delays scheduled system sleep. An enhanced version of memtest includes support for the newest Apple machines.<br>					</p>					<p>You do not need to install the memtest program for this application to work (Rember includes memtest inside of its application bundle). If you would like to run the memtest program from the command line (this also includes single user mode), see the &quot;READMEFIRST&quot; file inside of the enclosing disk image.<br>					</p>					<p>* Note that this application will only allocate as much free physical memory as it can for testing. This will not run tests on all blocks of memory, as all memory is not available when booted into the Finder. To do more thorough tests, see the &quot;READMEFIRST&quot; file in the &quot;Memtest413.dmg&quot; package. This describes how to run &quot;memtest&quot; in single user mode.<br>						 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>						<span class="version">Version Changes:<br>							 v. 0.1b 9/3/2004 Initial beta release.<br>						</span></p>					<p><span class="version">      v. 0.1.04b 9/5/2004 minor minor version change<br>							&#8226; Now uses spinning progressIndicator in main Nib file to lower the       amount of processor used by Rember application.<br>							&#8226; Uses updated version (4.04M) of memtest executable.<br>						</span></p>					<p><span class="version"> v. 0.2.0b 9/10/2004 minor version change<br>							&#8226; total GUI overhaul. <br>							&#8226; Preferences added. <br>							&#8226; Verbose logging (filtering) function added<br>							&#8226; Test progress in status field<br>							&#8226; loop counter<br>							&#8226; application/Finder quit functions<br>						</span></p>					<p><span class="version"> v. 0.2.1b 9/23/2004 minor minor version change<br>							&#8226; Preferences window is now a sheet<br>							&#8226; Save option for log details<br>							&#8226; Dock menu added<br>							&#8226; Icon added <br>						</span></p>					<p><span class="version"> v 0.2.2b 12/4/2004 minor minor version change<br>							<br>							&#8226; Performance enhancements<br>							&#8226; Icon touch-up<br>						</span></p>					<p><span class="version"> v 0.2.3b 1/25/2005 minor minor version change<br>							&#8226; Uses updated version (4.05M) of memtest executable<br>							- errors in memory testing are reported <br>							&#8226; Rember reports errors (Rember source unmodified)<br>						</span></p>					<p><span class="version"> v.0.3b 8/18/2005 minor version change<br>							&#8226; Uses new version of memtest executable (4.11)<br>							&#8226; Added &quot;Continue on Error&quot; preference<br>						</span></p>					<p><span class="version"> v.0.3.1b 12/22/2005<br>							&#x2022; Uses updated version (4.12) of memtest executable<br>							&#8226; Now saves preferences with user defaults<br>						</span></p>					<p><span class="version">v.0.3.2b  2/22/2006<br>							&#x2022; Uses updated version (4.13) of memtest executable<br>							&#x2022; Universal Binary<br>							&#x2022; Updated help</span></p>					<p><span class="version">v.0.3.3b 8/23/2006<br>							&#x2022; Displays determinate progress for tests<br>							&#x2022; Japanese localized<br>							&#x2022; Italian localized<br>							&#x2022; Bug fixes</span></p>					<p><span class="version">v.0.3.4b 9/16/2007<br>							&#x2022; New memory info window displays DIMM information<br>							&#x2022; New report window displays test results in human-readable format<br>							&#x2022; Rember now delays scheduled system sleep while tests are running<br>							&#x2022; Uses new version of memtest executable (4.2)</span><br></p>					<p><span class="version">v.0.3.5b 9/1/2009<br>							&#x2022; New icon and images<br>							&#x2022; Memory info window now compatible with Snow Leopard<br>							&#x2022; Improved progress display and output parsing<br>							&#x2022; Uses new version of memtest executable (4.22)<br>							&#x2022; Provides status via Dock icon while testing or on error</span><br></p>					<p><span class="version">v.0.3.6b 1/24/2010<br>							&#x2022; No longer accepts decimal input for loop for memory allotment<br>							&#x2022; Regression regarding memory info and early versions of Snow Leopard fixed<br>							&#x2022; Modernized (not classic 9) ProcessController class (used to quit other running apps before testing)<br>							&#x2022; Modernized power management functions for delaying idle system sleep<br>							&#x2022; Now localized in Russian and French Languages<br>							&#x2022; No longer limited to arbitrary limit of 8GB when allocating memory for testing</span><br>					</p>					<p>---------<br>						Rember v0.3.6b<br>						http://www.kelleycomputing.net/rember</p>				</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
