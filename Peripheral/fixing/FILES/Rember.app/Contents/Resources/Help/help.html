You can read more about it in the memtest bundle included with Rember, or by clicking the memtest link above.</p>					<p><strong>Question:</strong> When I run &quot;Rember&quot;, It gives me an error message reporting failure. There are messages in the log showing &quot;FAILURE: 0xfffffdff != 0xffffffff at offset 0x045f3242.&quot; . What does this mean, and what should I do?</p>					<p><strong>Answer: </strong>If you are not comfortable installing and un-installing hardware in a computer, you should take your machine to a service technician for diagnosis/repair. </p>					<p>If have experience replacing hardware, the only way to locate defective memory chips is by deduction - guess and check or split-half method troubleshooting. This may be updated in the future. You may also attempt to run the Apple Hardware Test CD or DVD that comes with most Macs. This may give more information (if it finds the problem).</p>					<p><strong>Question: </strong>Why does Rember eat up so much of the processor's         available cycles sometimes, and not at others?</p>					<p><strong>Answer:</strong> When the memory tests are running, the Rember         program is continuously logging, and (if chosen) filtering &quot;garbage&quot;         information (eg. command line progress indicators). This cuts down on         processor and memory hogging by Rember. When using this program to test         very small amounts of memory (example: 1MB), it will not be efficient.         When using the &quot;All&quot; option, this is alleviated. Leaving the         &quot;Log&quot; tab selected seems to be the most efficient.</p>												</td>  </tr></table></body></html>
