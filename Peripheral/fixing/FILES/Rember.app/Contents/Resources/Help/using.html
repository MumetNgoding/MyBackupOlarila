Memory         chips (aka RAM) can be responsible for unexplainable crashing, freezing,         file corruption, and other problems. With the advancement of technology,         computer parts (including memory chips) are getting larger, introducing         more of a margin for error. Rember will allow users to run tests to verify         that installed memory functions normally.</p>      <p><strong>When should I suspect defective memory?</strong></p>      <p>Sometimes, problems with memory can go unnoticed for lengthy amounts         of time. Other times, it is just plain difficult to diagnose the problems.         When defective RAM is installed, programs will unexpectedly quit, and         the computer will kernel panic. Most of the time, this occurs when using         many programs at one time. The user doesn't know when crashing will occur,         but knows to expect it.</p>      <p><strong>Try the Apple Hardware Test CD or DVD first!</strong></p>      <p>Macintosh computers currently ship with a version of the Apple Hardware         Test (AHT), which can perform some fairly heavy duty memory tests on a         computer. This should be one of the first lines of defense in diagnosing         computer problems. Although the AHT test are thorough, they have not proven         to find all defective memory. If these tests do not find the problem,         <em>then</em> give Rember a try.</p>      <p><strong>Why is Rember so successful?</strong></p>      <p>Rember uses one of the most precise, and thourough testing software available         for Mac OS X. Memtest is a command-line program ported from Linux that         has proven its reliability on the x86 side for years. This sofware is         also available for Mac OS X. Rember was developed as a front-end, or GUI         (Graphical User Interface) for the memtest application, and will allow         those less experienced in the command line (or CLI) to use the software.</p>      <p><strong>Using Rember</strong></p>      <p>To run memory test on your Mac, you can simply double-click on the Rember         application, select the amount of memory to test and number of loops to         run, then click the &quot;Test&quot; button. </p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td height="50%" align="center">Select the amount of memory to test,             either by attempting to get as much as possible, or by testing specific             amounts</td>          <td width="510" rowspan="2" align="center"><img src="images/main.png" width="523" height="416"></td>          <td width="15%" height="50%" align="center">Quit all other applications,             including the Finder to free up memory before testing.</td>        </tr>        <tr>           <td width="15%" height="50%" align="center">Specify the number of loops.             Infinite loops also available</td>          <td width="15%" height="50%" align="center">Verbose logging displays             even more information under the &quot;Log&quot; tab.</td>        </tr>      </table>      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td align="center"><p>&nbsp;</p>            <p>There are several options available to the user to increase the               functionality of this software.
